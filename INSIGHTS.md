# Business Insights Summary: SQLite Analytics Challenge

- The highest-spending customer, **Jacob Foster**, contributes over **$8.7k** in lifetime revenue—nearly double the spend of the fifth-highest customer. This shows a highly concentrated revenue distribution driven by a small group of top buyers.

- **Electronics** dominates the product portfolio, generating approximately **70–75%** of total revenue. This category significantly outperforms all others and represents the company’s primary revenue engine.

- **Furniture** ranks second but produces **less than half** the revenue of Electronics, revealing a large performance gap between categories and potential concentration risk.

- **Grocery and Stationery** categories contribute **under 5%** of revenue combined, indicating minimal financial impact and potentially low strategic priority for the business.

- Across all departments, exactly **one employee per department** earns above the department’s average salary. This suggests consistent pay structures in which each team has a single top earner or senior role receiving a compensation premium.

- **Tampa is the only city with Gold-tier customers**, making it the company’s strongest loyalty market and the primary region for high-value retention strategies.

- The extended loyalty distribution shows **Silver and Bronze customers are spread across more cities**, whereas Gold customers are **concentrated entirely in Tampa**. This indicates strong high-tier loyalty in one region and potential opportunities to grow premium loyalty programs in other markets.
